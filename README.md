# BattlePokerAnalyzer

Tool for analyzing BattlePoker replays

The aim is to produce insights into the value of BattlePoker hands

Please hit me up if you can provide some replays

Sample outputs:

TwoHandMatchups.csv - How much each specific hand wins against each specific hand
TwoHandWinRatesByHand.csv - How much each hand wins against any hand
WinRatesByIndividualUnit.csv - How much each unit type wins in whatever 2-card hand they're in against any 2-card hand
