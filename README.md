# BattlePokerAnalyzer

Tool for analyzing BattlePoker replays

The aim is to produce stats about the value of BattlePoker hands, and perhaps some visual charts or something

Please hit me up if you can provide some replays

## Current limitations

This is a work in progress so it's not very useful yet

* Only looks at 1 on 1 battles
* Doesn't account for card unit amounts
* Don't have enough replays

## Sample outputs:

* TwoHandMatchups.csv - How much each specific hand wins against each specific hand
* TwoHandWinRatesByHand.csv - How much each hand wins against any hand
* WinRatesByIndividualUnit.csv - How much each unit type wins in whatever 2-card hand they're in against any 2-card hand
